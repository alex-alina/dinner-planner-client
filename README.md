## Description
The MVP was developed as part of a full-stack web app for a real world project. A team of four developers and one UI/UX designer (all [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/) graduates) worked to develop/design it. 

The goal was to develop the basic features for a meal planner that helps people plan healthier meals more efficiently. It also included:
- creating user accounts
- a recipes' list
- generating a shopping list that included all the necessary ingredients in the right quantity (calculated for the number of household members)

This planner gives its users access to quality recipes, but it does not allow a user to add their own recipes. Only an admin could add recipes to the data base. 

#### Out of scope for this MVP:
* Creating an admin account or endpoints to add recipes were out of scope for this project so the recipes were added to the database by writing and running an SQL script with DBeaver. 

## Setup
* The backend (server) of this project must be running for the app to function correctly.
* Install the dependencies using `yarn install`
* Start the server using `yarn start`

## Contributions:
* Worked on the Shopping list page for which I build React's [presentational](https://github.com/alex-alina/dinner-planner-client/blob/master/src/components/shoppingList/ShoppingList.js) and [container](https://github.com/alex-alina/dinner-planner-client/blob/master/src/components/shoppingList/ShoppingListContainer.js) components together with the [action creators](https://github.com/alex-alina/dinner-planner-client/blob/master/src/actions/shoppingList.js) and [reducer](https://github.com/alex-alina/dinner-planner-client/blame/master/src/reducers/shoppingList.js) necessary for changing and updating the  redux state.

Working on a real world project in an agile team that included a well prepared Project Owner, a great UI/UX Designer and three hard working and solution oriented developers was a great opportunity and fun experience that came with so much learning and professional growth.

Good planning, SCRUM, open communication and a constant focus on priorities helped us deliver the required MVP in two weeks and for that I'd like to thank my teammates for their grit, determination, humor and positive attitude.
